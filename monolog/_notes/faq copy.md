<p>Are there any teas I should avoid while pregnant or breastfeeding?</p>
<p>For personal health questions, it is always best to speak to your doctor or healthcare provider. You will be able to find an ingredients list on each tea at www.gryphontea.com. This will hopefully provide you with the necessary information needed to ask your doctor on whether specific blends or ingredients are right for you.</p>


<p>Where can I find a complete list of ingredients for each tea?</p>
<p>You will be able to find an ingredients list on each tea at www.gryphontea.com. Simply type the tea name in the search bar or browse through the various tea categories to locate a specific tea and its ingredients.</p>


<p>Where can I find more information regarding allergies?</p>
<p>For questions regarding allergies, it is always best to speak to your doctor or healthcare provider before drinking our teas.</p>

<p>Do your teas contain sugar or calories?</p>
<p>Most of our teas contain virtually no sugar, carbohydrates or calories. However, do understand that it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the nutritional facts on tea since it is a natural product, like a fruit or vegetable. Calories and carbohydrates cannot be calculated due to the minuscule amount found in tea leaves. Without milk or sugar added to tea, tea contains very little calories.</p>

<p>How much caffeine is there in a cup of tea?</p>
<p>It’s hard to say for sure due to a ton of factors, such as water temperature and steeping time, that can change the amount of caffeine in a cup. Although it’s virtually impossible to measure the exact amount of caffeine in every cup, all our teas have been tested and rated with a general rating system as below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Caffeine-free</li>
  <li>Medium caffeine</li>
  <li>High caffeine</li>
</ul>

<p>Where are your teas blended?</p>
<p>Our team blends all of our teas by hand in small batches at our main office located at Singapore.</p>

<p>What makes Monogram different from other tea company?</p>
<p>Monogram not only empowers consumer to blend their own tea, it educate consumers how to do it. We are the first tea company that has come out with this concept.</p>


<p>Can I steep my tea more than once?</p>
<p>In many cases, the flavour profile will be unique with each steeping. Re-steeping is not necessarily recommended for tisanes. For best results, you should also only re-steep within the first couple of hours of the first infusion.</p>


<p>Why do your teas contain flavouring?</p>
<p>Rest assured that only natural flavourings are used in our blends. These flavourings are added to give each of our teas its unique taste profile. However, if you’re not keen on flavourings, we have plenty of other unflavoured blends available.</p>



<p>How long does your tea stay fresh?</p>
<p>Although tea does not go bad, it does become stale over time. We generally recommend drinking any of our teas within 2 years of purchase or before best date indicated.</p>


<p>What is the best way to store my teas?</p>
<p>We recommend that you store your teas away from direct sunlight and in a cool and dry environment.</p>
